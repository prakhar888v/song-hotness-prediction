Predicting song hotness using SAS Enterprise Miner and the 'Million Song Dataset'.

The Million Song Dataset (MSD), a collection of one million western popular music pieces, has enabled large-scale research. The dataset comes with a set of features extracted by the API of The Echonest, which include tempo, loudness, timings of fade-in and fade-out, and MFCC-like features for several segments. These datasets can help to build genre classification, recommendation systems, and cover song recognition.  
Right now, a company like Pandora relies on trained musicologists to build and expand its vast music database of characteristics that the company taps into to decide what to suggest for you next. 
Also, The National Science Foundation undertaking is called The Listening Machine Project. Launched eight years ago, the Project's objective was analyzing "the individual sources present in a real-world sound recording" which machines are not quite adept at doing it.  

As stated above, a good amount of research has undergone to analyze music datasets to build a more accurate recommendation system and genre classification features.

Based on some important data points related to a song, which define the structure of the song, like tempo, loudness, beats, fade-in time, fade-out time and other facts gathered from the Echonest database like artist hotness, danceability, and energy, I am trying to predict the song hotness level of a song.
